## Original Data Links (Deprecated)

- **Status**: Deprecated (no longer used in the current analysis)
- **Reason for Change**: The original data source was a Kaggle dataset that generalized SAS data from the 2022 CDC BRFSS Survey. Upon inspection, I found that it misclassified 'Unknown' responses as missing values, leading to inaccuracies. Therefore, I switched to the original 2022 BRFSS Survey Data and expanded the dataset by incorporating the 2023 BRFSS data, effectively doubling its size.
