   - **Summary**: 
    - About 90% of myocardial infarctions (MIs) are linked to modifiable risks, leaving the rest 10% unexplained.
    - The study identified 9 modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity) that accounted for ~90% of the population-attributable risk (PAR) for MIs globally.
    - The remaining ~10% of cases were not explained by these factors, suggesting contributions from non-modifiable risks (e.g., genetics) or unmeasured variables (e.g., inflammation, psychosocial stress).

   - **Summary**: 
    - Approximately 20% of myocardial infarctions occur in individuals without traditional risk factors, highlighting limitations in risk prediction.
    - A substantial number of heart attacks can occur in individuals with no prior history of heart disease or apparent risk factors, highlighting the need for ongoing research into the underlying causes.

  - Risk stratification: Stresses balancing sensitivity/specificity to avoid catastrophic false negatives.
  - Implication for Machine Learning: Validates the clinical rationale for prioritizing recall (even at the cost of lower precision) in acute settings.
