#  Heart Attack Prediction Model

## Project Introduction
This project focuses on building a heart attack risk prediction model that utilizes readily accessible and feasible features (physical condition, lifestyle, medical history, etc).

## Project Overview

### Problem Area
- **Problem Description**: Heart attacks are a leading cause of death worldwide, incurring long-term health issues and substantial financial costs. Current risk assessment tools are limited by their reliance on blood test results and age range restrictions. This project aims to create a more user-friendly, accessible risk assessment tool using readily available features.
- **Affected Groups**: Individuals with a family history of cardiac diseases, adults aged 40 and above, and health-conscious individuals concerned about their cardiovascular health are particularly affected.
- **Benefits of Outcomes**: With a predictive model for heart attack risk, users can identify their risk more accurately, recognize symptoms, and take preventive measures, ultimately reducing the incidence of heart attacks and improving health outcomes.

### Proposed Data Science Solution
- **Solution Overview**: The project will develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart attacks using accessible features. The goal is to create a user-friendly platform that allows real-time risk assessment.
- **Objectives**: To classify individuals based on their risk and provide actionable insights that empower users to take control of their cardiovascular health.

### Impact of Your Solution
- **Expected Outcomes**: The modelâ€™s implementation could significantly increase awareness of heart attack symptoms, potentially leading to an early response that can save lives. Reducing heart attack incidence, even by 1%, could save approximately 8,050 lives annually in the U.S.
- **Benefit to Stakeholders**: The project aims to lower healthcare costs associated with heart attacks, which are estimated at over $20,000 each in the U.S., leading to more sustainable healthcare systems.

### Dataset Description
- **Source of the Dataset**: The primary dataset is sourced from Kaggle (Indicators of Heart Disease, 2022 UPDATE) and is drawn from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
- **Overview of Dataset**: The dataset includes 445,132 observations and contains various features structured as follows:
  - **Dependent Variable**: `HadHeartAttack` (boolean)
  - **Feature Types**: 22 boolean variables, 11 categorical variables, and 6 numerical variables

### Data Dictionary
| Feature               | Type     | Description                                  |
|----------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| HadHeartAttack       | Boolean  | Indicates whether a heart attack occurred    |
| [Feature Name]       | [Type]   | [Description of what this feature represents] |
| [Feature Name]       | [Type]   | [Description of what this feature represents] |
| ...                  | ...      | ...                                          |

### Changes or Refinements to the Area of Interest
- **Refinements**: This project refines the focus to specifically target heart attack predictions rather than broader cardiovascular diseases, utilizing only the most relevant and accessible features for end users.

## Alternative Project Idea
My alternative plan is to create a predictive model for asthma risk, leveraging machine learning to address another critical health issue affecting approximately 241 million people worldwide. Early identification of patients at high risk for asthma exacerbations can significantly enhance care quality and reduce healthcare costs. I plan to use a dataset from Kaggle that includes 11 features with no missing values.

## Conclusion
The development of an accessible and effective heart attack prediction model has the potential to significantly impact public health. By empowering individuals with knowledge about their risk factors and relevant symptoms, the project can drive proactive health management and contribute to saving lives.
