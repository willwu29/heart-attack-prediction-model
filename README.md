# Heart Attack Prediction Model

![Heart Attack Prediction Model](src/HeartAttackPredictionModelGif.gif)

## Project Introduction

This project focuses on building a heart attack risk prediction model that utilizes readily accessible and feasible features (physical condition, lifestyle, medical history, etc).
=========================

## Project Overview
Heart attacks are a leading cause of death worldwide, incurring long-term health issues and substantial financial costs. Current risk assessment tools are limited by their reliance on blood test results and age range restrictions. This project aims to create a more user-friendly, accessible risk assessment tool using readily available features.



### Demo

### Organization

#### Repository 

* `data` 
    - contains link to copy of the dataset (stored in a publicly accessible cloud storage)
    - saved copy of aggregated / processed data as long as those are not too large (> 10 MB)

* `model`
    - `joblib` dump of final model(s)

* `notebooks`
    - contains all final notebooks involved in the project

* `docs`
    - contains final report, presentations which summarize the project

* `references`
    - contains papers / tutorials used in the project

* `src`
    - Contains the project source code (refactored from the notebooks)

* `.gitignore`
    - Part of Git, includes files and folders to be ignored by Git version control

* `conda.yml`
    - Conda environment specification

* `README.md`
